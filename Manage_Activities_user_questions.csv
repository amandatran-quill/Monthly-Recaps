I want to assign my students the same activity but at different class times. I thought I could change the publish time when class starts but it changes it for all my students. How do I assign the activity?
I have a new student in my third period class. Her name is Brooklyn Holbrook. She cannot see the assigned activities. Could you please assist me with this?
Abbi can no longer see the activities to complete. They are gone from her view. She was in the middle of completing today's activity and it disappeared while she was doing it. Are you stating that she should be able to view them now?
How can I post a link for students in GC so that they don't have to go to a separate tab to get to their dashboard?
"I assigned activities based on the diagnostic. However, I need students practicing certain ones first. They won't release until students have completed the activities in front of it. Can you help me?"
Caleb Glasscock is the only one now who cannot see the baseline. I imported the clasess from google classroom. Do you need the google class code or the quill class code?
Sophie Bretz is in my class English I B. She shows up on my roster. (On her screen she is also on English I A but I think I delted her from that class). The problem is that she is not showing any assignments. She does not have the preassessment that was assigned first. Can you help me to know what Ishould do?

"I am assigning independent practice under recommended practice-not yet proficient. I click the assign activities button and it just grays out and will not assign. I have updated Chrome, I have signed out and signed back in --it just remains frozen. How do I fix this?"
"Next question: once students have been reassigned the activity packs after the post test because they did not achieve proficiency in certain areas, can they take the post test again, and will the program keep track of how many times they retake the post test?"
How do I delete or edit a diagnostic?
