How can I unlock locked activities for students?
"Hello, I have a student who finished his diagnostic after his classmates. They all have the lessons assigned that were suggested after taking their diagnostics, but he doesn't. How can I assign them to him now?"
"Hi! After taking the diagnostic, are students automatically assigned activities that will help them based on that information or do I have to assign each activity to my students?"
My students did the diagnostic. Now what? Will quill assign them activities based on the diagnostic?
How can I get those activities to unlock?
and I accidentally deleted the students' scores from the intermediate diagnostic for english 12 period 2 (probably english 12 period 8 as well. Will you please make that information available again?
I would like for to use the feature that assigns activities based on student diagnostic scores. How do I do this?
Why can't I get it to assign and recommend activities automatically after the diagnostic is completed?
"I would like to be able to assign the recommended tasks after a diagnostic test into weekly tasks, so that I can see at a glance that students are meeting my criteria. I would prefer a weekly overview of their results as well. Is there any way this can be done?"
"I assigned activities based on the diagnostic. However, I need students practicing certain ones first. They won't release until students have completed the activities in front of it. Can you help me?"
